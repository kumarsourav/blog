A good introduction to the Monty Hall Problem can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ugbWqWCcxrg).

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
```text
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car;
behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say   No.1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick doorNo. 2?"
Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Under the standard assumptions, contestants who switch have a 2/3 chance of winning the car, while contestants
who stick to their initial choice have only a 1/3 chance.
 ```
## Simulation
On running this simulation, Monty Hall Problem started to converge towards the theoretical probability of 2/3 in case of switching the door and towards 1/3 in case of sticking with initial choice.
